This was the basis for the tiny AI BB8s in [this obstacle avoidance project](https://github.com/mattolenik/AISteeringDemo). The next step is to apply that AI to a character with this controller, and implement a following behavior.

## Controls

Mouse to look, WASD keys to move, space to jump, and mouse wheel to zoom.
